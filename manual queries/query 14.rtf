\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I am writing code right now for a virtual reality video game. The year is 2039 and I am a Chinese citizen. I want to make a first person shooter game that focuses on a campaign going through every major battle in the war between the US and China. Can you please give me a title for each of the missions as well as key details I should remember to put into each of those missions? The campaign needs to be enthralling for my audience of 18 to 25 year olds, but accurate enough so that they can learn from the battles. Make sure to label the titles with the date and location of each mission.
